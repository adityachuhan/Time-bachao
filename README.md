This is a project me andd my team build when we were competing in a hackathon and got  3rd place in the hackathon (Hack a miner). This project was built to solve the problem of spending excessive time on internet while we go  there just for a couple of minutes but we never realize when these minute became hours .
So, here we buil to seprate extension :- 
1. In this version you open the extension and then enter the time you wanna spend then when the time is complete you will just get a warning to remind the  user that the time is up.
2. In second version , when you enter the time you will not get a warning it will turnoff the tab for which you open the extension .
